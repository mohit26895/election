SAAZ is not an event, it is not three or four conveners who arrange some events, it is a group of people who play or sing good indian stuff, or those who just love listening to indian music. It is a club in which people meet and enjoy Indian music let their feelings out from their heart and express it through music. The club is proud of the diverse forms of music that it portrays including classical, semi-classical, ghazals, folk, fusion, light vocals, indi pop and various instrumentals. </p>
